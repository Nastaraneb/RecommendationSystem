# Explanation in Group Movie Recommendation

This project provides explanations for the recommendations generated by a group-based movie recommender system. Users can ask questions to understand why specific movies, genres, or positions appear (or do not appear) in the recommendation list.  

The system addresses the following types of user questions:  

1. **Why not a specific movie?**  
2. **Why not a specific genre?**  
3. **Why not a specific position?**  

Each question type is handled using well-defined logic and calculations, detailed below. 
This explanation system enhances transparency in group recommendations, helping users understand the reasoning behind the inclusion or exclusion of movies, genres, and rankings. By providing logical and detailed explanations, the system fosters user trust and engagement.

## Features  

### 1. Why Not a Specific Movie?  
When a user inquires about a movie missing from the recommended list, the system evaluates the following conditions:  

- **Condition 1:**  
   If the movie is among the top 50 movies for the group but not in the top 20:  
   - **Explanation:** The movie's group rating is lower than the ratings of the top 20 movies, justifying its exclusion.  

- **Condition 2:**  
   If the movie is not in the top 50 movies:  
   - The system checks whether any group member marked it as their favorite.  
      - If **no member** rated it as a favorite:  
        - **Explanation:** None of the group members expressed significant interest in this movie.  
      - If **any member** rated it as a favorite:  
        - The system calculates the group rating for the movie, compares its rank with those in the recommended list, and provides an explanation based on its position.

### 2. Why Not a Specific Genre?  
When a user questions the absence of a specific genre in the recommendation list, the system follows these steps:  

- **Step 1:**  
   Calculate the group's interest in all genres based on the top 100 movies (using average group ratings).  

- **Step 2:**  
   Determine the percentage of group interest in the queried genre.  

- **Explanation:**  
   If the genre is missing from the recommendation list, the groupâ€™s interest in it is likely very low (e.g., 0.5% or 2%), which justifies its exclusion.

### 3. Why Not a Specific Position?  
Users can ask why a movie is ranked at its current position instead of a different position (e.g., "Why is Movie X ranked 5th instead of 2nd or 7th?").  

- **Logic:**  
   The system compares the group rating of the movie at the requested position with its current position using the formula:  

   ```text
   How Much Better = (Current Movie Rate - Requested Rank Rate) / Requested Rank Rate
